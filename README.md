# Hi, I'm Sonny Salamone! 👋

## 🧬 About Me
I'm a fourth-year Computational Biology & Bioinformatics major, minoring in Cognitive Neuroscience. My academic journey blends analytical science with hands-on lab expertise and a passion for unlocking complex biological data.

## 💡 Top Skills
- **Programming:** Python, SQL, Java, R
- **Technical Lab Skills:** Experimental design, statistical analysis, data visualization
- **EEG Expertise:** Data acquisition and analysis
- **Bioinformatics:** Genomics, transcriptomics, biological databases

## 🔬 Featured Project: Multisensory Research Software
Currently, I’m building a [Multisensory Stimulus Presentation and Data Collection System](https://github.com/SonnyS10/Software-for-Paid-Research-), designed to present and synchronize visual, tactile, and olfactory stimuli while collecting EEG, eye tracking, and behavioral data.

**Key Features:**
- Synchronized multisensory stimulus presentation
- Real-time EEG and eye tracking data collection
- VR integration and control using PsychoPy and PTVR
- Automated trial sequencing and variable interval control
- Arduino-driven hardware (odor/tactile systems, viewing booth)
- Response time and craving rating measurement

**Tech & Tools:** PsychoPy, EMOTIV Pro, SR Research, Lab Streaming Layer, Arduino IDE, VR hardware
